[ID=introduction]
--Is this thing on? Ahem--Hello! 
This is Max. Boss must've mentioned an additional briefing?
Before we start, check your phone. Dead, right? 
This place's a bit special, so without Boss' pager, you're off the grid. 
Try not to lose it... 

Also, be careful not to trigger anything while you're looking, 'cause the previous owners were a little eccentric. 
Don't worry though, I heard the traps are surface trauma only!
 
Lastly, your task.
You're looking for an old, emerald brooch. Should be somewhere in the West wing. 
Try finding it before sundown.--
