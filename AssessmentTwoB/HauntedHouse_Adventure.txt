(ID)[Introduction]
(Desc)--Is this thing on? Ahem--Hello! 
(Desc)This is Max, going over the main points again.
(Desc)Before we start, check your phone. Yup, dead. 
(Desc)This place's a bit special so without Boss' pager, you're off the grid. 
(Desc)Try not to lose it, along with the floorplan of the place.
(Desc)
(Desc)Also, be careful not to trigger anything while you're looking. 
(Desc)Don't worry if you do though, I heard the traps are surface trauma only!

(Desc)Try finding it before sundown, you've got the keys.--
(Choice)[Ask_Max]Ask a question.
(Choice)[Front_Porch]Put away the pager.

[Scene]
(ID)[Ask_Max_Time]
(Desc)--I heard the previous owners used to run a haunted house right out of this manor... though now it's abandoned.

(ID)[Forest]
(Stat)+

(Desc)until they stop entirely.
(Desc)It's as though the forest's residents have only just found the stranger in their midst.

(Choice)[Front_Porch]Leave the forest.
[EndScene]

[Scene]
(ID)[Lobby]
