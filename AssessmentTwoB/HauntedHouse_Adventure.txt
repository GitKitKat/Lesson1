(ID)[Introduction]
(Desc)--Is this thing on? Ahem--Hello! 
(Desc)This is Max, going over the main points again.
(Desc)Before we start, check your phone. Yup, dead. 
(Desc)This place's a bit special so without Boss' pager, you're off the grid. 
(Desc)Try not to lose it, along with the floorplan of the place.
(Desc)
(Desc)Also, be careful not to trigger anything while you're looking. 
(Desc)Don't worry if you do though, I heard the traps are surface trauma only!
(Desc)

(Desc)Try finding it before sundown, you've got the keys.--

(ID)[Ask_Max_Time]
(Desc)--I heard the previous owners used to run a haunted house right out of this manor... though now it's abandoned. 
(Desc)Apparently the props move around after dark. True or not, I'm sure you don't wanna find out.--
(Choice)[Ask_Max]Ask another question.
(Choice)[Front_Porch]Put away the pager.
[EndScene]

[Scene]
(ID)[Front_Porch]
(Desc)After putting the pager away, you take note of your surroundings.
(Desc)You are standing on the front porch. Ahead of you is the manor's front door.

[EndScene]

[Scene]
(ID)[Forest]
(Desc)The tree canopy looms overhead, and the intermittent noises of small animals grow further apart until they stop entirely.
(Desc)It's as though the forest's residents have only just found the stranger in their midst. 
(Desc)Surrounded by a deathly quiet, you can't tell if the blooming shadows are tricks of the light,
(Desc)or figures inching closer. 
(Choice)[Front_Porch]Leave the forest.
[EndScene]

[Scene]
(ID)[Lobby]
(Desc)The doors to the manor open easily. The interior is well-lit due to several large windows. The lobby is well-furnished, but many items that look like antiques are half-covered by thin tarps and dust.

[EndScene]

[Scene]
(ID)[Garden]

[Scene]
(ID)[Greenhouse_Search]
(Desc)Unfortunately, today isn't your lucky day. Facing your fruitless efforts, you recall a clause in your contract that allows clients to sue for stolen items.
(Desc)On second thought, it's good that you didn't find anything remarkable.
(Choice)[Garden]Leave the green warehouse.

[Scene]
(ID)[Garden_Vandal]
(Desc)After picking up a shovel, you wreak havok on the shrubbery until you can see layers of cracked tiles underneath.

(Choice)[Garden]Put away the shovel.

(ID)[Vandal_Predecessor]
(Desc)As you continue your war of attrition with surprisingly resilient plant-life, an opening is formed and you hear a hollow thud.
(Desc)As the object rolls to a halt at your feet, you realize it's a small skull. How did it get here?
(Desc)Perhaps it's not worth finding out from experience.
(Choice)[Garden]Put away the shovel.

(ID)[Interruption]
(Desc)As your surroundings start to dim, you notice a slight tremor in your step. Although you're confident you can continue, it wouldn't be too bad to take a break, right...? 
(Desc)With a last quick glance at your surroundings, you return to the manor's lobby.
(Choice)[Lobby]Continue after taking a break.
(Choice)[Exit]Leave the manor.

[Scene]
(ID)[End_Time]
(Desc)As the sun sets, are your goosebumps a result of the lingering cold, or your fear of the unknown? One thing's for sure: you're not sticking around to find out. 
(Desc)You'll be one day further away from your paycheck, but what's a little money compared to sleeping well at night?
(Choice)[Exit]Leave the manor.
